This is a visualization of the Linked Open Data [1] cloud using the Protovis 
JavaScript library [2]. The underlying data is generated by talking to the 
Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) API [3].

In order to view index.html in your browser you'll first need to generate
the lod.js file using ckan.py.

    ./ckan.py

If you would like to generate the lod.js on a regular basis just add it to 
your crontab, e.g. to update data every hour:

    0 * * * * cd /var/www/inkdroid.org/lod-graph; ./ckan.py
